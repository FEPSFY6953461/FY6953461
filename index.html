    This paper argues that there are several limitations surrounding the use of deep learning models in 
    healthcare systems. Convoluted neural networks are now the most communly used tool in tumour diagnosis, 
    classification and medical imaging. The article is evaluated on systemic data and figures obtained by
    private healthcare centres and training data sets from hospitals. We conclude that the main limitations 
    are scarcity of data, clinical trust in model interpretability, poor generalisation and ethical and 
    practical issues
