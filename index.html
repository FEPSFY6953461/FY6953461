    This paper argues that there are several limitations surrounding the use of deep learning models in 
    healthcare systems. Convoluted neural networks are now the most communly used tool in tumour diagnosis, 
    classification and medical imaging. The article is evaluated on systemic data and figures obtained by
    private healthcare centres and training data sets from hospitals. We conclude that the main limitations 
    are scarcity of data, clinical trust in model interpretability, poor generalisation and ethical and 
    practical issues

      The aetiology of cancer has always been a topic open to scientific and even philosophical debate. 
      Over the centuries, the medicinal world has seen exponential progress in technological advancements, introducing 
      devices such as X-rays and CT/PET scans which have completely reformed medical imaging and in particular tumour diagnosis. 
      MRI is widely used to identify and classify tumours in the brain and other organs. Deep Learning models have become 
      integrated in most hospitals as studies have proved it helps doctors classify tumours faster and more accurately. 
      However, problems such as insufficient data due to patient privacy and inconsistent model performance across hospitals. 
      This review aims to highlight and critically assess the key limitations in deep learning approaches in MRI-based tumour diagnosis. 
      The criteria of limitations which will be addressed are:
      
      Scarcity of data
      Model interpretability and clinical trust
      Poor generalisation
      Ethical and practical issues
